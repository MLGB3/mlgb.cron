Document codes from 'list.master' with no corresponding entry in Key.doc

A very few of these look like typos. I can correct a few of them myself without needing further
guidance, but in the case of others, I would need you to tell me what it should be.

	{{JW interlineated}}

B55{P} -- full stop after the {P} instead of before                        -- I can correct this
	Thanks

K6666  -- a valid format in theory, but a very large number                -- please advise
	It should be K666

U06    -- this is a zero not a letter O                                    -- I can correct this
	Thanks

U33    -- presumably should be either UC or UO                             -- please advise
	UO please

UC19*  -- full stop after the asterisk instead of before                   -- I can correct this
	Thanks

UC1434 -- once again, a rather large number (next-largest UC code = UC175) -- please advise
	Should be UC144.1

A few have just the alphabetic part of the code, with no number. I can let you know exactly where
these appear in the file if you want.

BA   	JW:   	BA.911b should be BA1.911b      
BC	JW:	BC.1081c should be BC4.1081c            
BM	JW:	BM.210c should be BM1.210c
FA      JW:	FA.518g should be FA8.518g      
SH	JW:	SH14 should be SH14.12            
SS	JW:	SS.185 should be SS1.185            

The remainder look like valid entries that just don't appear in Key.doc:

BA11   JW:	should be BA1       
BC101  JW:	= Inventory of books in library of Canterbury College, Oxford, 1443       
BC103  JW:	= Inventory of books in library of Canterbury College, Oxford, 1501

FC5    JW:	ditto       
H112   JW:	I can't find this one in the masterfile.       

K2     JW:	All the K-references mean the same thing, no matter what number follows the letter.
		So the key for each reference is: 'Henry de Kirkestede, Catalogus, c. 1360'       

R1 	JW:	Likewise all the R-references, They all stand for: 'Registrum Anglie, early 14th cent.'

P7  	JW:	= Leland, c. 1536-40
P8      JW:	= Lincolnshire list, 1528

P7 and P8 both relate to Tupholme, P9 relates to Welbeck. They are all Premonstratensian houses.
